                    <p>I fixed his TE situation by giving him the amazing Jordan Reed.  But I didn't need Jordan Reed, and he gave me Mike Williams.  I'm not opposed to making another team better if it helps me out too.  That's why trades are awesome.  And you guys should follow our lead.  Speaking of lead, Andrew has a massive one this year.  A surefire playoff top-seed, this team is locked and loaded, however the RB2 situation for this team is not good.  Jonathan Taylor is getting phased out and not the guy fantasy managers had hoped for.  Still, this team is so strong that it covers it up, and JT can score any given day so it's not the end of the world.</p>

                    <p>Andrew has fantasy talent.  Trevor has fantasy skill.  The RB depth here is good so he has a sly Mckissic play whenever he wants, even after the Dobbins trade isn't working out.  Adding an RB is always good and Andrew wishes he had trevor's chances at solidifying an RB2.  Both these top teams are flawed though because RB2 is an important position.  But Kelce is just ridiculous.  This team could win it all.</p>

                    <h4>Analysis</h4>
                    <p>When you put my team into a computer at the start of the season, it will tell you it's the worst team ever, but guess what, it isn't.  In fact, it's been the best team 3 different times this season already.  Tom Brady is unquantifiable.  It's why he was drafted late in real life, and it's the same reason you all passed on him.  It just doesn't make sense how a 43 year old slow white man is the best athlete football has ever seen, but he is.  With Nick Chubb miraculously back and Mixon on the way for a competent Bengals offense, and Hunt, I'd argue I have the best RB room in our league.  No Dalvin Cooks here but I have a twin engine jet where I can fly on either one.  That's how I think of RBs.  Only time I ever took the ship was with Le'Veon and Demarco Murray both going off and a rookie Odell.  So that's the formula for me.  2 great backs and a breakout WR.  Tryna replicate it with my boy Tee Higgins and Brandon Aiyuk.  Really bad drops, guys.  Just really REALLY bad drops.  I see a rookie WR with talent on waivers, I take.  Thanks =)</p>

                    <p>I think the reason why I haven't ranked this team before is the bench.  This is an awful, awful bench.  However,  Kyler is a monster and Derrick Henry eats monsters for breakfast and then stiff-arms them for 100 yard runs.  Davante wish-I-Had-ams is the best player in the NFL and scores the most touchdowns, period.  I think it's easier to replicate his stats with a 3rd or 4th round receiver than it is to replicate the stats of a Dalvin Cook with a 3rd or 4th round back, but even I wish I took him in the first round because he's just so damn good.  Juju showing signs of life.  Tight end is strong because of Herbert now.  This team's really good, but Gurley's not that great anymore and like I said, terrible bench.  </p>

                    <p>Maybe if he got Keenan Allen out of his lineup he might win some games.  Haha I'm just kidding he's ok now that he has a stud QB but I'd still bench him for AB.  Did you guys see the end of the Cardinals game?  Diggs was talking so much shit after a go ahead TD with 30 seconds left.  He was talking crap with his helmet off like he's the best in the world, and then D-Hop's like, "No you ain't, son." and catches a hail mary.  When you drop a Nuke in Call of Duty, the game's over.  Same thing in football.</p>

Has a strong enough record to take some L's as long as it improves in time for the playoffs.  I think DeAndre is a must start.

                    <p>Devonte Booker should be picked up.  It doesn't mean I don't like Jacobs, but still.  He deserves an add.  Not much to say here for these bottom dwellers who have yet to crack the power rankings.  Chris, benching DJ Moore is just not a good idea.  Robby Anderson is an illusion.  Moore is the most talented WR there, and it's a good offense.  He's a high draft pick and an every week start.  You have to ride the wave with your studs.  Metcalf has a couple 4 point games.  Doesn't matter to me at all.  Shouldn't matter to you either.  Believe in the guys you drafted.  They often have a way of turning it around.  I would also get Jerry Jeudy in there over Cooks, but that's just me.  It's honestly not that bad of a team. Just some tough luck this year.  At least you have Dalvin Cook.  Mckenna, have fun with AJ Green!  I prefer Tee Higgins because when Joe throws to him, good things happen.  I've watched all the Bengal games and Green just isn't making plays anymore.  In conclusion, Trevor and I are planning a playoff preview podcast.  Should be about as epic as the new spiderman game.  If you're thinking of getting an xbox x instead of a ps5, hmm, how should I put this... that's like starting Brandin Cooks over DJ Moore. You're missing out.</p>
