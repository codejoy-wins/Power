                    <p>It's only fitting that George Kittle just got injured on Team Physical Therapy, but Andrew Seif's skills in fantasy football are not to be underestimated.  Dodging the ACL tear of Beckham was huge, and AJ Brown is a dynamic player he basically got for free along with Aaron Rodgers, which is a huge upgrade from Wentz.  New question marks surround Jonathan Taylor but with CMAC coming back, that's worth at least 3 running backs.</p>

                    <p>Every year, Trevor's team gets better as the season goes on and he's always in the playoff hunt. I apologize for giving Trevor his RB2.  I was 0-3 and I panicked.  I couldn't wait for Gronkowski to get going and Trevor fleeced me.  With Ingram Out, Dobbins just put up over 100 yards on Pittsburgh, so the sky's the limit for him, and this team.  Probably the best team in the league unless Andrew figures out something at tight end. </p>

An embarrassment of riches at WR make this team extremely dangerous.  Too bad Clyde seems to have lost his job.  Le'Veon being there is a huge problem for this team.

I could also be down for a rental because I think Fulgham is legit.  Titans haven't won since they stopped featuring Jonnu Smith.  Coincidence? Probably.</p>

                    <p>I'm going to really break this team down for my boy, Kazz.  Drop TY Hilton, he sucks.  You can't be confident starting Diantae after so many zeros so trade him after next big game.  And for god sakes is Cooper's value ruined.  Do not start him.  I think your tight end sucks, but whatever, they all do.  Now for the good stuff.  Russell Wilson is playing out of his mind and was a great pick.  Miles Sanders seems like a true 3 down back when healthy and I like his skillset.  Le'Veon Bell to the Cheifs is like a dream, good pick.  Jefferson is nice and I'd start him over Cooper.  Julio is like a fantasy cheat code.  Great D, good kicker.  Good team overall with room to improve.</p>

                    <p>At the beginning of the year, it looked like a great team because of Ridley, Lamb, and Prescott.  With the Cowboy's injuries at QB, Lamb is unplayable and your QB spot suffers immensely with no good backup plan.  Ridley banged up and slowing down really hurts too.  Still got Tyreek HIll which is huge.  I think this team needs Eckeler.  Nice job on securing the backup Seattle back.  I thought Swift was going to be a thing but I guess not?  I was thinking Fulgham for Singletary but now I don't think I can with Fulgham leading the league in receiving since his first start.</p>

                    <p>I didn't have a good feeling about Zeke this year.  I don't know why, I just didn't.  His poor play is devestating to this team.  Kenny G banged up.  "Experts" say to trade Mike Evans.  But I say that's retarded.  Great draft pick.  Jarvis gets a bump with Odell out but Landry is battling injuries and not his usual self.  Engram is athletic for a tight end and I like him after Monday night's grab.  Melvin Gordon had a DUI which isn't a good sign.  Deshaun Watson just isn't the same without Hopkins, and was probably a poor pick at where he went.</p>

                    <h4>Analysis</h4>
                    <p>I'm disappointed in the lack of trades.  I get that people are stingy and you have to give up more than you get to push it through, but sometimes rosters demand trades.  I'm fine with drafting 5 usable running backs but to not trade any and then struggle at other positions is inexcusable, RBU.</p>  
                    <p>Dalvin Cook is a monster but Chris's team can't put a good week together.  Needs a QB.  I was kind of appalled Herbert was on the wire.  I feel like every year there is a rookie Phenom QB so why no one rostered him is beyond me.  I would have if I didn't have like 3 top 10 qbs already.  Ernie's team with Davonte Adams as a monster struggled this week.  Starting a third string TE for Philly shows me that you aren't paying attention with two better options on your bench. Sven's team is just not that dangerous.  When you take a Lamar Jackson you put an immense amount of pressure on him to perform at an MVP level to return that investment.  It's just not a good strategy to take a QB early.  Unless you're Patrick Mahomes, I guess. But still, Aaron Rodgers in the 12th plus a 2nd round pick is always going to be better than Patrick Mahomes and a 12 round pick.  Get that through your head, guys. It doesn't make sense to take wide receivers early either, unless there is a Calvin Johnson.  There's just too many good options that emerge throughout the year.  Tee Higgins and Travis Fulgham cost me nothing and are third and first in receiving in the past 4 games.  It's just impossible for that to happen with running backs and you have to focus your draft on running backs.  That's really all that matters.  The rest of the positions you can fill in as you go, but you must secure multiple quality backfields if you want to outsmart a Trevor Goodwin.  Sorry if I come off as a dick, I love you all and actaully want you to win!  Just look at my genorous trades!!  That's all, gentleman.  </p>
