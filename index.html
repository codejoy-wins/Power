                    <h4>Analysis</h4>
                    <p>Devon's Team just lost it's greatest weapon.  Dak Prescott is out for the forseeable future.  He also recently lost Austin Eckeler.  I happen to not like Austin Eckeler.  Devin Singletary provides nice depth to keep this team seamlessly at the top.  He has no backup QB, so should spend big for Justin Herbert this week.</p>

                    <h4>Analysis</h4>
                    <p>Justin's team has to bench a WR1 every week, which speaks to the depth he has at the position.  My advice?  Bench Keenan Allen.  He's overrated.  The James Robinson pickup really drives this team because it hides the fact that he took a QB early.</p>

                    <p>If Kenny Golladay and Evan Engram live up to their potential this team could win it all.  However, given that he's rostering 2 kickers and Danny Amendola, I think he'll screw it up.  Also have no idea about the team name.</p>

                    <p>Wheeling and dealing, my team now has a strong TE for the rest of the year.  And when Chubb comes back, I get to flex Kareem Hunt. Joe Mixon has the best day of an RB so far with 42 points.  Odell looks healthy.  TD Metcalf is a monster.  Tom Brady has upside when Godwin and Evans get healthy.  Only the top 3 teams above me scare me.</p>

                    <p>He probably picked his kicker just because of the name.  Tyler Lockett has come back down to earth.  Will A-Rod?  He's getting huge production from Davis with CMC injured.  Too bad he can't have them both going at the same time.  Kittle gives him an edge at the position, so this team depends on the health of AJ Brown, and surviving the cardinal sin of trading Odell Beckham Jr.</p>

                    <h4>Analysis</h4>
                    <p>Chose Matt Ryan over Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers.  I was thrilled when he did that.  Boasting the best TE, RB, and K in the league, this team has holes that can be plugged up by it's star players.  If he somehow gets an RB2, watch out.  Trevor likes to target amazing receivers on horrible teams.  This is something I personally would never do.  Because if your team only scores 7 points, you can only get one touchdown.  Trevor likes targets, and we'll see if it works out for him.</p>

                    <h4>Analysis</h4>
                    <p>RBU has too many running backs and should trade one to a team like Trevor's who will pay a king's ransom.</p>  
                    <p>Devin should trade Julio while he still can, and should have been on Chase Claypool instead of consistent 0's from D. Johnson.  The D stands for "Does not finish the game".  Sven, when your best player tears his ACL you aren't going to make the playoffs without superb managing, and you're just not there yet.  Fuck you too. =)  Stop rostering so many Defenses lol I think my browns D proves that you do not need to care about d/st or kickers unless you have a top option.  It's a crapshoot and you're better off rostering someone like Claypool before they go off.  It was nice to see Chris put up some points last week.  Charlie's team is pretty bad, mostly because Michael Thomas is not returning value.  Maybe you should have traded him after the injury.  That's all, gentleman.</p>
